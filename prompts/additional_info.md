You should research online for Kansas labor market data, Wichita demographics, and local workforce/upskilling resources.
Focus on the most relevant and active community partners in Wichita and South Central Kansas, especially those already collaborating with the Kansas Department of Labor (KDOL), Kansas Department of Commerce, and Workforce Alliance of South Central Kansas (WASCK).

Key data sources and partners to prioritize:
	1.	KansasWorks – the official state workforce portal (job listings, training programs, and registered apprenticeships).
	2.	Workforce Alliance of South Central Kansas – operates the Wichita Workforce Center and regional WIOA programs.
	3.	WSU Tech (Wichita Promise) – tuition-free technical training in manufacturing, healthcare, IT, and aviation; strong industry partnerships.
	4.	Butler Community College Workforce Education & Training – short-term certificates and customized training programs.
	5.	Newman University Adult and Professional Studies – upskilling for adults balancing work and education.
	6.	Wichita Regional Chamber of Commerce / Greater Wichita Partnership – local employer network and economic data.
	7.	Kansas Registered Apprenticeship Program – administered by KDOL and Commerce; key for earn-while-you-learn paths.
	8.	Wichita Public Library (Digital Skills & Career Workshops) – essential for citizens with limited digital access.
	9.	Local employers in advanced manufacturing, healthcare, and aviation (Spirit AeroSystems, Textron Aviation, Ascension Via Christi, etc.) as end-user partners for placement pathways.

Research Scope:
	•	Pull labor market statistics (unemployment rate, top industries, occupational demand) from KDOL, Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), and Greater Wichita Partnership reports.
	•	Include demographic data (education levels, income, under-represented populations) from U.S. Census and Wichita Open Data.
	•	Map program coverage — e.g., which local programs teach digital, healthcare, or skilled-trade skills




Time constraints: We have three hours, but need slide examples within 30 min. Prioritize research over speed for now.

  3. Deliverable Format & Weighting:
  - Should the pitch deck be the primary artifact with others as appendices, or are all three equally
  important?
  - What's the expected length/depth for each deliverable?
We need the pitch deck first, but all three artifacts are important.

  4. Technical Scope:
  - For the technical walkthrough - are you expecting architecture diagrams, tech stack recommendations,
  MVP features, API integration specs, or all of the above?
  - Should this be build-ready or conceptual?
Start with a tech stack description.

  5. Geographic Scope:
  - Is this specifically for Wichita or statewide Kansas? (Challenge mentions both)
Statewide, not just Wichita.
