# PathwayKS Pitch Deck Content
## Slide-by-Slide Outline

### Slide 1: Title
**PathwayKS: Connecting Every Kansan to Opportunity**
Tagline: Your personalized pathway to career success

### Slide 2: The Problem
**Kansas' Workforce Paradox**
- 70,000+ job openings across the state [Source: KansasWorks.com, 2025]
- Only 30.1% of Wichita adults have bachelor's degrees [Source: U.S. Census Bureau, 2024]
- Citizens face fragmented information across 10+ websites
- Transportation, childcare, and digital access barriers prevent training participation
- High-demand industries (aerospace, manufacturing, healthcare) struggle to fill positions

### Slide 3: The Gap
**What's Missing?**
Despite strong infrastructure:
- 27 KansasWorks Workforce Centers statewide [Source: KansasWorks.com]
- Tuition-free training through WSU Tech Wichita Promise [Source: WSU Tech, 2025]
- 1,500+ registered apprenticeship occupations [Source: Kansas Commerce, 2025]
- Butler CC workforce certificates and Newman University adult programs

**The Problem:** No unified platform to connect citizens to the right pathway

### Slide 4: Target Market
**Who We Serve**
- **Primary**: 273,000+ Kansas adults with some college but no degree [Source: U.S. Census]
- **Secondary**: Unemployed (3.8% unemployment = ~60,000 Kansans) [Source: BLS, July 2025]
