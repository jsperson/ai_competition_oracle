## 1. Problem Statement

### 1.1 The Workforce Paradox

Kansas faces a significant workforce development challenge characterized by simultaneous abundance and scarcity:

**Supply Side (Job Seekers):**
- Wichita population: 396,119 with median household income of $63,072 [Source: U.S. Census Bureau, 2024]
- 88.3% of Wichita adults have high school diplomas, but only 30.1% have bachelor's degrees [Source: U.S. Census Bureau, 2024]
- 273,000+ Kansas adults have some college credits but no degree [Source: U.S. Census estimates, 2024]
- 3.8% unemployment rate translates to approximately 60,000 unemployed Kansans [Source: BLS, July 2025]
- Additional underemployed population seeking career advancement

**Demand Side (Employers):**
- 70,000+ job openings across Kansas [Source: KansasWorks.com, 2025]
- 450+ aviation companies unable to fill skilled positions [Source: Kansas Department of Commerce, Aerospace Industry, 2025]
- Spirit AeroSystems (6,000 employees) and Textron Aviation facing talent shortages [Source: Greater Wichita Partnership, Major Employers, 2025]
- Healthcare sector experiencing critical workforce gaps
- Advanced manufacturing ranks #4 nationally in jobs as percentage but struggles with pipeline [Source: Greater Wichita Partnership, 2025]

### 1.2 Infrastructure Exists But Is Fragmented

Kansas has invested significantly in workforce development infrastructure:

**Workforce Centers:**
- 27 KansasWorks Workforce Centers statewide + 2 mobile centers [Source: KansasWorks.com, 2025]
- Workforce Alliance of South Central Kansas covering 6 counties (Butler, Cowley, Harper, Kingman, Sedgwick, Sumner) [Source: Workforce-ks.com, 2025]
- Free services including job matching, resume assistance, career coaching

**Training Programs:**
- WSU Tech Wichita Promise: Tuition-free training in 4 new programs (Unmanned Aircraft Systems, Digital Marketing, Mental Health Technician, Cloud Computing) added Fall 2025 [Source: WSU Tech, 2025]
- Kansas Registered Apprenticeship: 1,500+ occupations across 170 industries [Source: Kansas Department of Commerce, Registered Apprenticeship, 2025]
- Butler Community College: 30+ years of workforce training, CompTIA certifications, CDL training, healthcare certificates [Source: Butler CC Workforce Education, 2025]
- Newman University: Accelerated online 8-week courses for working adults [Source: Newman University Adult & Professional Studies, 2025]
- Wichita Public Library: Free technology training and career workshops [Source: Wichita Public Library, 2025]

**The Problem:** Despite this robust infrastructure, citizens cannot effectively navigate the ecosystem. Information is scattered across separate websites, eligibility requirements are unclear, and no personalized guidance exists.

### 1.3 Systemic Barriers

Kansas workforce development faces multiple systemic barriers:

**Information Fragmentation:**
- Job seekers must visit 10+ separate websites (KansasWorks, WSU Tech, Butler CC, Newman, etc.)
- No unified search or comparison capability
- Inconsistent terminology and program descriptions
- Outdated information on individual sites

**Transportation Barriers:**
- Research shows transportation is a critical determinant of workforce participation [Source: KU Transportation Research, 2021]
- Students without after-school transportation have limited access to internships and job opportunities
- Rural areas face particularly acute transportation challenges
- Existing assistance programs (Kansas WorkforceONE Transportation Assistance) are underutilized due to low awareness [Source: Kansas WorkforceONE, 2025]

**Childcare Barriers:**
- 80% of Kansans agree affordable childcare strengthens the economy [Source: Kansas Reflector survey, 2024]
- Childcare providers report excessive paperwork, lack of communication, and stringent eligibility requirements create barriers [Source: Kansas Reflector, October 2024]
- Inadequate reimbursement rates and delayed payments reduce provider availability
- Childcare assistance exists through Kansas WorkforceONE but is difficult to access [Source: Kansas WorkforceONE, 2025]

**Digital Skills Gap:**
- National Skills Coalition research shows significant digital skill divide impacting workforce participation [Source: National Skills Coalition, February 2023]
- Citizens with limited digital literacy cannot navigate online job boards and training applications
- While Wichita Public Library offers free digital skills training, awareness is low [Source: Wichita Public Library, 2025]

**Skills Gap in High-Demand Industries:**
- Kansas Department of Commerce developed Workforce Aligned with Industry Demand (AID) program specifically to address skills gaps [Source: Kansas Board of Regents Workforce Development, 2025]
- Healthcare, advanced manufacturing, aviation, and IT sectors report difficulty hiring skilled workers [Source: Kansas City job market analysis, 2025]
- Services sector expected to grow year-over-year for 2025-2026, driven by healthcare and financial services [Source: Kansas economic outlook, 2025]

## 11. Conclusion

PathwayKS represents a transformational opportunity to modernize Kansas workforce development and create measurable economic impact across the state. By building a unified platform that connects citizens to personalized career pathways, we can address the critical workforce paradox: thousands of job openings coexisting with citizens seeking upskilling and career change.

### Key Success Factors:

1. **Strong Foundation:** Kansas has invested significantly in workforce infrastructure (27 centers, tuition-free programs, apprenticeships), but lacks integration. PathwayKS builds on this foundation rather than replacing it.

2. **Proven Need:** With 70,000+ job openings, 273,000+ adults with some college but no degree, and high-demand sectors struggling to fill positions, the market need is validated by data.

3. **Government Partnership:** Kansas Department of Labor backing provides credibility, distribution, and sustainable funding model.

4. **Technology Advantage:** AI-powered matching, API integration, and barrier navigation features differentiate PathwayKS from generic national platforms.

5. **Measurable Impact:** Clear success metrics (enrollments, placements, earnings increases) enable data-driven decision-making and demonstrate ROI.

### Path Forward:

- **Immediate:** Secure $1.5M seed funding for 18-month runway
- **Months 1-3:** Launch pilot with 500 users in Sedgwick County
- **Months 4-6:** Expand to 6-county region with 2,500 users
- **Months 7-12:** Statewide rollout reaching 10,000 users
- **Year 2-3:** Scale to 50,000+ users and explore expansion to neighboring states

PathwayKS is more than a technology platform—it's a catalyst for economic growth, social mobility, and workforce transformation in Kansas. With the right partnerships, funding, and execution, we can create a national model for how states should approach workforce development in the 21st century.
