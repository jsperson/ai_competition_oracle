## üéØ Project Overview: LaunchKS

**LaunchKS** is a unified digital platform designed to connect Kansas citizens to personalized upskilling and career change pathways. The solution addresses a critical workforce paradox: Kansas has 70,000+ job openings while hundreds of thousands of adults struggle to navigate fragmented workforce development resources.

### The Challenge

The competition presented an Oracle track challenge focused on:
- **Problem Definition:** Clearly define a workforce development problem and solution
- **Research Integration:** Identify and integrate local community partners and resources
- **Impact Estimation:** Quantify the value and impact for Kansas
- **Deliverables:** Create a pitch deck, business plan, and technical walkthrough

### The Solution

LaunchKS provides:
1. **AI-Powered Pathway Matching** - Personalized career recommendations based on skills, interests, and constraints
2. **One-Stop Program Hub** - Aggregated training programs from WSU Tech, Butler CC, Newman University, and more
3. **Barrier Navigator** - Transportation, childcare, and financial assistance coordination
4. **Partner Integration** - Direct API connections to KansasWorks, training providers, and employers
5. **Progress Tracking** - Milestone-based journey with coaching and support

### Key Impact Projections

**Year 1:**
- 5,000 users complete assessments
- 1,500 enrollments in training programs
- 750 job placements
- $37.5M in increased earnings

**Year 3:**
- 25,000 users
- 10,000 enrollments
- 5,000 job placements
- $250M in increased earnings
- $12.5M/year in increased tax revenue

## üîç Methodology: The Oracle Approach

This project exemplified the Oracle track's core competencies:

### 1. Surgical Information Extraction
- Researched 20+ community partner organizations
- Extracted labor market data from government sources
- Identified 1,500+ apprenticeship occupations
- Mapped 27 KansasWorks workforce centers statewide

### 2. Citation Excellence
Every claim in all deliverables includes precise source attribution:
```
[Claim] [Source: Organization/Document, Date]
```
Examples:
- "70,000+ job openings across the state [Source: KansasWorks.com, 2025]"
- "273,000+ Kansas adults have some college but no degree [Source: U.S. Census Bureau, 2024]"

### 3. Noise Filtering
- Distinguished between state-level and regional programs
- Verified current vs. outdated program information
- Cross-referenced data across multiple authoritative sources
- Prioritized active community partners with DOL relationships

### 4. Synthesis Mastery
- Connected workforce development infrastructure gaps to specific solutions
- Integrated data from education, labor, commerce, and community organizations
- Translated research findings into actionable business and technical plans
- Aligned solution features with documented barriers (transportation, childcare, digital access)
